# Hi there, I'm Jill 👋

I'm a frontend engineer with 6+ years of experience building scalable, accessible user interfaces and improving system reliability across enterprise and public-sector applications. I enjoy bridging the gap between design and engineering—turning concepts into intuitive, functional experiences.

## 🛠 Tech I Use

- **Languages & Frameworks:** JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, React, Redux, HTML5, CSS3
- **Tools & Libraries:** Playwright, Jest, Storybook, Webpack, GitHub Actions
- **Accessibility:** WCAG, ARIA, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Backend Exposure:** Node.js, Express, REST APIs, GraphQL, Java, Spring Boot  
- **Infrastructure & DevOps:** Docker, AWS (S3, CloudFront)
- **Design Collaboration:** Figma, design systems, UI documentation

## 🔍 What I'm Working On

Testing and customizing open-source libraries to better understand how they're used in production

## 📌 About My Repos

You'll see a mix of:
- **Forked open-source tools** I’ve tested, explored, or lightly customized for real-world use  
- **Archived or legacy projects** from earlier in my career (college or early professional work)  
I keep these visible to reflect the evolution of my skills and interests — but I’m actively curating this list to highlight what’s most relevant to the frontend and product-focused work I do today.
